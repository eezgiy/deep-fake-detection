Different Models Such as ResNet, EfficientNet, Vgg16, MobileNet, CNN were used to train the models.

Data augumentation methodologies were used to balance the dataset.

Related confussion matrixes, classification reports, loss values, evalution metrics and ROC curves can be found at the related Jupyter Notbeook.
